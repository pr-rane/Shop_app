# Shop_app

Shop_app is an e-commerce app that features a simple filterable product list. You can login into existing user account. 
The Products data comes from the FakeStoreApi [Site](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

## Architecture

The app is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
The Shop_app has a single activity that hosts all fragments while the Navigation component handles the fragment transactions.
